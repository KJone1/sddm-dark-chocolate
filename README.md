## Motivate a developer

In the past years I have spent quite some hours on open source projects. If you are the type of person who digs attention to detail, know how much work is involved in it and/or simply likes to support makers with a coffee or a beer I would greatly appreciate your donation on my [PayPayl](https://www.paypal.me/marianarlt) account.  
Alternatively downloading my themes directly from opendesktop or with the kde sddm system settings module will at least help me a little to be able to attend your issues and requests.  
Please consider helping developers you think are worth a penny or two, literally.
